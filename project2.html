                <p class="project__intro">
                    This group project was designed to as a assignment for a course called "Information Beyond Screens".
                    The project is a design and iterative development of an interactive spinning carousel prototype,
                    created
                    within the themes of quantified self and street. <b>The initial goal</b> was to create some type of
                    exercise equipment that generated electricity in a battery and used the stored energy to charge
                    mobile devices. This idea would align with the theme quantified self and the area street assigned
                    for our project.
                </p>

                <!-- Design Process -->
                <h2 class="section__title-2">Design Process</h2>
                <p class="project__process">
                    <b>Iteration 1:</b> Our initial concept emerged from a desire to merge physical activity with
                    sustainable energy production. We envisioned installing exercise equipment, specifically a
                    stationary exercise bike, in public parks. The bike would be equipped with a generator to convert
                    the mechanical energy from pedaling into electrical energy, which would then be stored in an
                    adjacent battery unit. This setup would serve as a charging station for mobile devices,
                    incentivizing users to engage in physical activity while contributing to renewable energy efforts.
                    <br>
                    <b>Iteration 2:</b> Acknowledging the limitations of our initial idea, we shifted our focus toward
                    creating an interactive experience for children. We conceptualized a spinning device—a carousel—that
                    would encourage physical activity through play. The initial design was a small apparatus intended
                    for one child to stand and spin independently. This pivot aimed to foster physical engagement in a
                    manner that was both intuitive and enjoyable for younger users.
                    <br>
                    <b>Iteration 3:</b> In response to the feedback we got from the teacher and other students, we
                    expanded the carousel's design to accommodate multiple children simultaneously. The larger carousel
                    promoted social interaction, allowing children to play together, fostering teamwork, and enhancing
                    the overall enjoyment of the experience. We recognized that play is not only about physical activity
                    but also about social development and learning to interact with others.
                    <br>
                    <b>Iteration 4:</b> To enrich the user experience and deepen engagement, we decided to integrate
                    multisensory feedback into the carousel. We introduced auditory elements by incorporating the
                    popular children's song "Baby Shark." The music would play automatically when the carousel started
                    spinning, with the tempo increasing in correlation with the speed of rotation. This feature provided
                    immediate, intuitive feedback, encouraging children to spin faster to hear the song accelerate.

                <h2 class="section__title-2">Outcome</h2>
                <p class="project__outcome">
                    The final product is an interactive spinning carousel designed to encourage physical activity and
                    engagement in public play spaces. Key features include automatic activation, multisensory feedback
                    with sound and light, and quantified self-inspired elements such as a rotation counter and heat
                    sensors. The carousel successfully integrates implicit and embodied interaction principles, creating
                    a seamless, engaging experience for children while addressing safety and educational aspects through
                    iterative user-centered design.
